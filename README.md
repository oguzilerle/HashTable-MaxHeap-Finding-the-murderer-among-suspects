# HashTable-MaxHeap-Finding-the-murderer-among-suspects
As the chief of homicide bureau, you are charged to find the murderer(s) in a murder case. Each murder suspect is held by a unique avatar name in the system. Also, according to the statements of eyewitnesses, each suspect has been assigned a probability of committing the murder. Depending on new evidences, the probability values may need to be updated. For that reason, we need a dynamic data structure. Also, you want to make an evaluation on each suspect in the order depending on their probability values. Therefore, you decide that using a maximum heap would be very helpful and efficient. Also, you see that there will be some parts that you need to hold &lt;avatar, heap detail> where ’heap detail’ can be any info that you should note during the heap operations (This info totally depends on your implementation). In order not to affect the performance of heap operations negatively, you decide that using hashing for such pairs would be the best choice. To sum up, first you need to implement a general hash table as described in the below parts. Later, you need to implement a maximum heap to order the suspects depending on their probability values and do some operations on that heap as described in the following parts.
